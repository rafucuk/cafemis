# Upgrade Notes

## 2024.10.0

### Hellspawns

Cafemis versions before 2024.10 suffered from a bug in the "Mark instance as NSFW" feature.
When a user from such an instance boosted a note, the boost would be converted to a hellspawn (pure renote with Content Warning).
Hellspawns are buggy and do not properly federate, so it may be desirable to correct any that already exist in the database.
The following script will correct any local or remote hellspawns in the database.

```postgresql
/* Remove "instance is marked as NSFW" hellspawns */
UPDATE "note"
SET "cw" = null
WHERE
	"renoteId" IS NOT NULL
	AND "text" IS NULL
	AND "cw" = 'Instance is marked as NSFW'
	AND "replyId" IS NULL
	AND "hasPoll" = false
	AND "fileIds" = '{}';

/* Fix legacy / user-created hellspawns */
UPDATE "note"
SET "text" = '.'
WHERE
	"renoteId" IS NOT NULL
	AND "text" IS NULL
	AND "cw" IS NOT NULL
	AND "replyId" IS NULL
	AND "hasPoll" = false
	AND "fileIds" = '{}';
```

## 2024.9.0

### Following Feed

When upgrading an existing instance to version 2024.9.0, the Following Feed will initially be empty.
The feed will gradually fill as new posts federate, but it may be desirable to back-fill the feed with existing data.
This database script will populate the feed with the latest post of each type for all users, ensuring that data is fully populated after the update.
Run this after migrations but before starting the instance.
Warning: the script may take a long time to execute!

```postgresql
INSERT INTO latest_note (user_id, note_id, is_public, is_reply, is_quote)
SELECT
	"userId" as user_id,
	id as note_id,
	visibility = 'public' AS is_public,
	"replyId" IS NOT NULL AS is_reply,
	(
		"renoteId" IS NOT NULL
			AND (
			text IS NOT NULL
				OR cw IS NOT NULL
				OR "replyId" IS NOT NULL
				OR "hasPoll"
				OR "fileIds" != '{}'
			)
		) AS is_quote
FROM note
WHERE ( -- Exclude pure renotes (boosts)
				"renoteId" IS NULL
					OR text IS NOT NULL
					OR cw IS NOT NULL
					OR "replyId" IS NOT NULL
					OR "hasPoll"
					OR "fileIds" != '{}'
				)
ORDER BY id DESC -- This part is very important: it ensures that we only load the *latest* notes of each type. Do not remove it!
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING; -- Any conflicts are guaranteed to be older notes that we can ignore.
```
